# Dev Teraphy 🚀

As a Software Engineer. I sometimes feel burnt out, and as much as I love writing codes, I lose appetite to write codes and do other major stuff. One way I discovered to beat burnout is by talking to people. So I decided to build an app that connects developers to other teraphists.

## Features 🧰

1. Appointment schedule with Google Calender API
2. Chat system ( I might use supabase realtime for that not sure yet)
3. Find and talk to teraphists

## Technologies 🔧

1. NextJs
2. ReactJs
3. Tailwindcss
4. Supabase (Auth & Database)
5. Shadcn Ui (UI Library)
6. Google calender API (appointment schedule)
7. Methane CLI (A CLI tool I built React & NextJs component) [Checkout Methane Cli](https://github.com/adedoyin-emmanuel/methane-cli)
